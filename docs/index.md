# Data Structures in Python

I created this repository to give a good and easy representation of data structures
in python language.

## Roadmap
This repo presents the following data structure from foundation to advanced level.

- [Arrays](array.md)

- [Linked List](src/algostructure/linked_list)

- [Binary and Binary Search Trees](src/algostructure/binary_tree)

- [Hash Table](hash-table.md)

- [Stack and Queue](stack-and-queue.md)

- [Graphs](graphs.md)
