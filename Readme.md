# Data Structures in Python

I created this repository to give a good and easy representation of data structures
in python language.

## Roadmap
This repo presents the following data structure from foundation to advanced level.
- [Arrays](src/algostructure/arrays)
- [Linked List](src/algostructure/linked_list)
- [Binary and Binary Search Trees](src/algostructure/binary_tree)
- Hash Table
- Stack and Queue
- Graphs


## Next Steps

Implementation of Algorithms will be presented later.
